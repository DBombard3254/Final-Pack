From what i gathered for my attendance, not including the first few weeks that i was not enrolled into the class, i have missed 3 days due to either vehicle problems or being ill.

In terms of participation for my group, i had a good amount of input when we first started the project on how we are going to do it and what kind of ideas we should have.
I was labeled as the "Support" but in reality along side that i also helped with Documention on the project board and even some research in clients and applications that we might use.
We all did our specific parts in our groups but everyone helped out each other in some way, it was a very good team building experience and i enjoyed doing it and working with my group memebers.
